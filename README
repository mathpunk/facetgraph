Quickstart:

Open up index.html in a web browser.

Directory guide:

ajax/ - files containing examples of graph files
	testgraphcenter.json
	testgraph2.json
	testgraph3.json

cgi-bin/ - files that should be put on the server's cgi executable directories, 
	 their job is to supply
	 graph and other data as input to the facet graph. If not querying a 
	 database (i.e. if setup.json is empty) 
	 the graph data can be put in the /ajax directory, and the
	 contents of the file start.json will be displayed when index.html
	 is loaded up.

	 facetgraph/
		newgraph.py	- a cgi script responsible for returning a graph
				in the format outlined in graph-format.readme
		navigation.py	- a cgi script responsible for describing the
				contents of the top navigation bar
		autocomplete.py - a cgi script that provides input to the
				autocomplete script for the top bar
		dbsetup.py - where the class definitions for interfacing with
			   a MYSQL + sqlalchemy db live. If you're not using a 
			   database as the source of your data, don't bother with
			   this file.
		getdata.py   - a script that queries the database (or some black-
			     box backend) and returns the information the graph
			     should contain. In the default version (which
			     queries the new york times linked open dataset)
			     this file's job is to get data from that API and
			     package it up into graph format.
